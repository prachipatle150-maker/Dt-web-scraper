TASK 2 — COMPANY PROFILING  
Company: Nestlé Health Science  
Objective: Identify whether the company is actively involved in probiotics and assess the strength of that involvement.

PART 1 — Probiotics Identification Framework

This framework defines how probiotics involvement can be identified from a company’s website.

1. Probiotics Product Presence  
What to look for:  
- Products explicitly labeled as probiotics  
- Mentions of live cultures, gut health products, or microbiome solutions  

Why it matters:  
Direct product presence indicates active commercial involvement in probiotics.


 2. Scientific / &D Orientation  
What to look for:  
- Research pages mentioning microbiome or probiotics  
- References to clinical studies or scientific validation  

Why it matters:  
Probiotics-focused companies usually invest in research and evidence-based claims.

 3. Regulatory & Quality Signals  
What to look for:
- Certifications (GMP, ISO, pharma-grade compliance)  
- Claims related to regulated nutrition or medical foods  

Why it matters:
Serious probiotics companies operate under strict quality and regulatory standards.


 4. Application Areas  
What to look for:
- Gut health, digestive health, immunity, medical nutrition  
- Human health or clinical nutrition use cases  

Why it matters:  
Probiotics are commonly linked to these application areas.


 5. Commercial Intent  
What to look for: 
- Probiotics positioned as core offerings  
- Dedicated product lines or brands  

Why it matters:
Distinguishes core business activity from casual or marketing-only mentions.
